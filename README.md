# 2020-Census-Findings-NYC
A tract-level geographic inspection of demographic shifts in Brooklyn, NY using 2010 and newly published 2020 Census data

The first of these inspections covers Hispanic/Latinx population displacement in Brooklyn with a focus on seven tracts in West Bushwick. Findings illustrate a mass exodus of Hispanic/Latinx residents from these tracts over the last decade. The overall population counts in these tracts have stayed consistent, and the Census data reveals that White non-Hispanic and multi-racial non-Hispanic resident counts have increased in a magnitude roughly equal to the Hispanic/Latinx decreases.
